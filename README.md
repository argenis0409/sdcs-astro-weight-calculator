Welcome to my Astro Weight Calculator.

In this project you will be able to check how much you would weight in your favorite planet, if you had the oportunity to go to space.

To see the project working is simple, copy the project files in your code editor then run npm start,
once you do that, you will see an output looking like this >> "serving "." at http://127.0.0.1:8080" 

Ok have fun and hope you like it.
